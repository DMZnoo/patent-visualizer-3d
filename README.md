# Patent Force-Directed Graph

## What I've learned
- Three JS
- Instance rendering with the Particle System
- Data filtering
- react-three-fiber

## To improve
- Better context management 
    1. A lot of redundant variables being used across Canvas and App provider
    2. Very verbose way of instantiating and use of context
- Theme Switching on the toggle button
    - Needs to be updated so that the data-theme in css is being used to enable dark: modifier on tailwind instead of manual checking of `appTheme` variable
- Improve UX
    1. Hard to navigate with the tooltip being propping up everywhere.
    2. Zoom to view selected
